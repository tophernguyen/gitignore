# gitignore
Just put this file in every folder before you do a git commit.  This will keep git from accidentally adding the files to your commit.  Examples that I'm currently avoiding to upload are keys, pw and important things I would keep in an .env file.  If I am using a jupyter notebook, it'll avoid uploading the additionaly notebook files.



# TODO
This is just a file I found via google. Find out where I got this file.
